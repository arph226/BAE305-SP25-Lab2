4. DC Power Supply

# Test Procedures


# Test Results
The results obtained for step 1 of the Test Procedures are shown in the table below. All resistors were found to be in tolerance

**Resistor Values Table**
|Color Code|Expected Value (&Omega;)|Tolerance(%)|Measured Value (&Omega;)|Within Tolerance|
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|Brown Black Blue|10M|5|10.25M|yes|
|Orange Orange Red|3.3k|5|3.297k|yes|
|Brown Green Brown|750|5|749.9|Yes|
|Red Red Gold|2.2|5|2.3|yes|

The results obtained for step 2 of the Test Procedures are shown in the table below. The 22&mu;F and 102&mu;F capacitors were not in tolerance, all other capacitors were.

**Capacitor Values Table**
|Expected Value (&mu;F)|Tolerance(%)|Measured Value (&mu;F)|Within Tolerance|
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|10|20|10.44|Yes|
|1|10|1.1|Yes|
|102|10|1.34|No|
|22|5|6.36|No|

The results obtained for step 3 of the Test Procedures are shown in the table below. The set voltages were very close, if not exactly the same, as the measured voltages. Errors were likely due to DMM measurement since sometimes values would continue to change on the DMM after the probes were attached. This could lead to some measurement error.

**DC Power Source Voltage Output Table**
|Set Voltage (V)|Measured Voltage (V)|
|----------|----------|
|1.56|1.494|
|7.00|7.00|
|12.00|12.01|
|3.3|3.389|

**Function Generator Output Table**
|Measurement Method|Frequency (kHz)|Amplitude (V)|
|----------|----------|----------|
|Cursors|4.81|5.04|
|Counting Squares|5|5|
|Measurement Features|4.66|5.25|
|Fluke DMM|4.66|0.126|
